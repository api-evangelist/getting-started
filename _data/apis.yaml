- name: Getting Started
  description: A getting started page for APIs is all about getting the new and potential
    API consumer up to speed with what it takes to get started with an API. This is
    my research to track on the different approaches, and aggregate into a single
    approach I can apply to my own APIs, as well as share along the way. I have started
    crafting an API to help me organize all of it, so stay tuned.

    description: This is my professional presence as the API Evangelist, where I work
      to better understand the world of APIs. Im always working towards a better understanding
      of how they are being used, both the good and the bad, across the technology,
      business, and politics of APIs as I see it.
